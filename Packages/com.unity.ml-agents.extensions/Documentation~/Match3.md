# Match-3 with ML-Agents

<img src="images/match3.png" align="center" width="3000"/>

## Overview
One of the main feedback we get is to illustrate more real game examples using ML-Agents. We are excited to provide an example implementation of Match-3 using ML-Agents and additional utilities to integrate ML-Agents with Match-3 games.

Our aim is to enable Match-3 teams to leverage ML-Agents to create player agents to learn and play different Match-3 levels. This implementation is intended as a starting point and guide for teams to get started (as there are many nuances with Match-3 for training ML-Agents) and for us to iterate both on the C#, hyperparameters, and trainers to improve ML-Agents for Match-3.

This implementation includes:

* C# implementation catered toward a Match-3 setup including concepts around encoding for moves based on [Human Like Playtesting with Deep Learning](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/328307928_Human-Like_Playtesting_with_Deep_Learning)
* An example Match-3 scene with ML-Agents implemented (located under /Project/Assets/ML-Agents/Examples/Match3). More information, on Match-3 example [here](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/tree/release_13_docs/docs/docs/Learning-Environment-Examples.md#match-3).

### Feedback
If you are a Match-3 developer and are trying to leverage ML-Agents for this scenario, [we want to hear from you](https://forms.gle/TBsB9jc8WshgzViU9). Additionally, we are also looking for interested Match-3 teams to speak with us for 45 minutes. If you are interested, please indicate that in the [form](https://forms.gle/TBsB9jc8WshgzViU9).  If selected, we will provide gift cards as a token of appreciation.

### Interested in more game templates?
Do you have a type of game you are interested for ML-Agents?  If so, please post a [forum issue](https://forum.unity.com/forums/ml-agents.453/) with [GAME TEMPLATE] in the title.

## Getting started
The C# code for Match-3 exists inside of the extensions package (com.unity.ml-agents.extensions).  A good first step would be to familiarize with the extensions package by reading the document [here](com.unity.ml-agents.extensions.md).  The second step would be to take a look at how we have implemented the C# code in the example Match-3 scene (located under /Project/Assets/ML-Agents/Examples/match3).  Once you have some familiarity, then the next step would be to implement the C# code for Match-3 from the extensions package.

Additionally, see below for additional technical specifications on the C# code for Match-3. Please note the Match-3 game isn't human playable as implemented and can be only played via training.

## Technical specifications for Match-3 with ML-Agents

### AbstractBoard class
The `AbstractBoard` is the bridge between ML-Agents and your game. It allows ML-Agents to
* ask your game what the "color" of a cell is
* ask whether the cell is a "special" piece type or not
* ask your game whether a move is allowed
* request that your game make a move

These are handled by implementing the `GetCellType()`, `IsMoveValid()`, and `MakeMove()` abstract methods.

The AbstractBoard also tracks the number of rows, columns, and potential piece types that the board can have.

##### `public abstract int GetCellType(int row, int col)`
Returns the "color" of piece at the given row and column.
This should be between 0 and NumCellTypes-1 (inclusive).
The actual order of the values doesn't matter.

##### `public abstract int GetSpecialType(int row, int col)`
Returns the special type of the piece at the given row and column.
This should be between 0 and NumSpecialTypes (inclusive).
The actual order of the values doesn't matter.

##### `public abstract bool IsMoveValid(Move m)`
Check whether the particular `Move` is valid for the game.
The actual results will depend on the rules of the game, but we provide the `SimpleIsMoveValid()` method
that handles basic match3 rules with no special or immovable pieces.

##### `public abstract bool MakeMove(Move m)`
Instruct the game to make the given move. Returns true if the move was made.
Note that during training, a move that was marked as invalid may occasionally still be
requested. If this happens, it is safe to do nothing and request another move.

### Move struct
The Move struct encapsulates a swap of two adjacent cells. You can get the number of potential moves
for a board of a given size with. `Move.NumPotentialMoves(NumRows, NumColumns)`. There are two helper
functions to create a new `Move`:
* `public static Move FromMoveIndex(int moveIndex, int maxRows, int maxCols)` can be used to
iterate over all potential moves for the board by looping from 0 to `Move.NumPotentialMoves()`
* `public static Move FromPositionAndDirection(int row, int col, Direction dir, int maxRows, int maxCols)` creates
a `Move` from a row, column, and direction (and board size).

#### `Match3Sensor` and `Match3SensorComponent` classes
The `Match3Sensor` generates observations about the state using the `AbstractBoard` interface. You can
choose whether to use vector or "visual" observations; in theory, visual observations should perform
better because they are 2-dimensional like the board, but we need to experiment more on this.

A `Match3SensorComponent` generates a `Match3Sensor` at runtime, and should be added to the same GameObject
as your `Agent` implementation. You do not need to write any additional code to use them.

#### `Match3Actuator` and `Match3ActuatorComponent` classes
The `Match3Actuator` converts actions from training or inference into a `Move` that is sent to` AbstractBoard.MakeMove()`
It also checks `AbstractBoard.IsMoveValid` for each potential move and uses this to set the action mask for Agent.

A `Match3ActuatorComponent` generates a `Match3Actuator` at runtime, and should be added to the same GameObject
as your `Agent` implementation.  You do not need to write any additional code to use them.

### Setting up Match-3 simulation
* Implement the `AbstractBoard` methods to integrate with your game.
* Give the `Agent` rewards when it does what you want it to (match multiple pieces in a row, clears pieces of a certain
type, etc).
* Add the `Agent`, `AbstractBoard` implementation, `Match3SensorComponent`, and `Match3ActuatorComponent` to the same
`GameObject`.
* Call `Agent.RequestDecision()` when you're ready for the `Agent` to make a move on the next `Academy` step. During
the next `Academy` step, the `MakeMove()` method on the board will be called.
